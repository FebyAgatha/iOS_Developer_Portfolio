### 🔍 Background
- **Opportunity Statement** : When joining a new environment at Apple Developer Academy, User (Apple Developer Academy Learners) wants to get to know with other learners but many still struggle to remember names due to the large number of learners.
- **Solution Statement** : Our Solutions uses Swift Frameworks to efficiently store and display ADA learners’ profiles, including their names, nickname, interests, hobby, and SIG so that new learners can easily recall information about their peers

### 👩‍💻 Role & Responsibilities
- Designed app UI with **SwiftUI**
- Implemented **SwiftData** for local data persistence
- Integrated camera using **UIKit**

### 📚 What I Learned
- Gained a solid understanding of Apple’s Human Interface Guidelines to design intuitive and consistent user experiences
- Explored the Swift ecosystem, including SwiftUI for UI development and SwiftData for local data persistence
- Applied the MVVM architecture pattern to write more structured, maintainable, and scalable code
- Practiced using Git within Xcode to manage version control effectively
- Improved team communication and collaboration through regular discussions and problem-solving as a group

### 🔧 Areas for Improvement
- Apply better visual hierarchy in future designs to guide user focus more effectively
- Refactor and clean up code logic to improve readability and maintainability
- Enhance UI to be more responsive and adaptable, including support for Dynamic Type
